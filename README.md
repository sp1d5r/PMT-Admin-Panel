This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## PMT Admin Panel

This is the admin panel for the physics and maths tutor app (to be released hopefully within the next year). 

The app was built front to back from scratch by me, and this was a simple quick website I made to allow the content creators to publish revision notes and questions to students all across the world.

Unfortunately, I'm on a bit of a tight schedule for now so I can't walk you through what the website does but star this and I'll update it soon.
